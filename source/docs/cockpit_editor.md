Cockpit comes with a web-based code editor that enables us to change our application's source code on the fly. Just like any other typical editor, it has a file tree, can open multiple source files and lets us add and delete files.

## Additional features for Smart Contract files

When opening a Smart Contract source file in Cockpit's editor, we'll get additional features and options to work with. These features are **Interact**, **Details** and **Transactions**, very similar to the ones we've discussed in [Exploring Smart Contracts](/docs/cockpit_explorer.html#Exploring-Smart-Contracts).

Cockpit will open up dedicated view for each of these in another in-pane window as shown below:
