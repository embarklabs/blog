Subspace 1.3
===

New to subspace? Check out the website at [http://subspace.embarklabs.io/](http://subspace.embarklabs.io/)

### New methods available to track blocks, gas price and blocktime

#### `trackBlock()`
Returns the block information for any new block as soon as they are mined. It's the reactive equivalent to `web3.eth.getBlock("latest")`.
```js
subspace.trackBlock().subscribe(block => console.log(block));
```

#### `trackBlockNumber()`
Returns the latest block number. It's the reactive equivalent to `web3.eth.getBlockNumber`.
```js
subspace.trackBlockNumber().subscribe(blockNumber => console.log(blockNumber));
```

#### `trackGasPrice()`
Returns the current gas price oracle. It's the reactive equivalent to `web3.eth.getGasPrice`.
```js
subspace.trackGasPrice().subscribe(gasPrice => console.log(gasPrice));
```

#### `trackAverageBlocktime()`
Returns the moving average block time taking in account the latest 10 blocks. The time is returned in milliseconds:
```js
subspace.trackAverageBlocktime().subscribe(blocktimeMS => console.log(blocktimeMS));
```

### Bug fixes
- Web3 subscriptions are reused, which means that calling a track method with the same parameters more than once will not create a duplicate subscription. 

### Contributions

Subspace and the entire Embark labs organization are open source. As such we welcome contributions and input from the community using the product.
